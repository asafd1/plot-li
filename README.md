# Plot Li



## Plot What? 

Plot Li in hebrew (פְּלוֹט-לִי) means 'dump for me'.

This [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) app is a plot generator based on OpenAI's [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) (via [revChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT)), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) & [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

## What does it do?

Tell it what plot you want in natural language and it will generate it for you.

## Disclaimer

This was a hackathon project built in 2 days. It has a lot of assumptions and short cuts, so it's not 100% mature or productized but it's a good start. We might invest more in it in the future.

## Credits 

This project was created as part of a hackathon we did in [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com) Tel-Aviv.
Team was: Tal Bar-Natan (the one and only), Zohar Avraham, Rachel Berger, Daniel Peretz & Ishai Meisels.
